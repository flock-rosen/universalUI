<h2>UniversalUI for macOS</h2>

UniversalUI has been designed as a plug-and-play solution for developing macOS apps. 
It is packaged as a dynamic library (.dylib) so in order to get started, all you need
is to download the latest UniversalUI-macOS.zip xcode project, and add your code
in there. 

Alternatively, you can find the header files in the "UniversalUI" folder of the repository 
root, the pre-compiled dylib in the "Dylib-Standalone" subfolder, and the example Xcode 
project in the "Xcode-Project" subfolder.
